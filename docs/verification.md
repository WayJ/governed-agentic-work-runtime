# Verification coverage

Updated: 2026-10-13 (S1 contributor preview) · Maintained by the contributor wave; behavior evidence lives in `tests/test_runtime.py`.

This report states what the local reference prototype actually verifies, and what it explicitly does not. Coverage below refers to the acceptance matrix in [RFC-003 §9](RFC-003-runtime-protocol.md); it is not a claim that RFC-001 or RFC-002 as a whole is implemented.

## Scope of the verified system

- A **local, single-process reference prototype**: an in-process Python library over SQLite. There is no server, no remote protocol transport, and no multi-tenant authorization; protocol commands are library calls.
- **Local trust, not authentication.** Actor names (`agent`, `finance`, …) come from a grants map supplied by the embedding application. They distinguish trusted local principals; they do not authenticate remote callers. RFC-003 §2.1 (identity from trusted connections) is deferred.
- **The external system is a stand-in.** `FakeOA` is a separate local SQLite database modeling an external service with idempotent submit, lookup, and invoice uniqueness. No real external system integration exists yet.
- A **single coordinator**: state changes serialize through one runtime per work database. Distributed worker leases are not implemented (P13 below).

## How to verify

```bash
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v          # tests gate (all cases below)
python3 scripts/check_docs.py                     # contracts gate (local doc links)
python3 -m work_runtime demo                      # demo gate (real crash recovery)
python3 -m compileall -q work_runtime tests scripts  # syntax gate
python3 scripts/verify_install.py                 # fresh-venv install + demos outside the checkout
```

## Protocol acceptance matrix (P01–P15)

Definitions: [RFC-003 §9](RFC-003-runtime-protocol.md). All evidence tests are in `tests/test_runtime.py` (the 35 baseline tests; the parallel runtime wave may add more at integration).

| Case | Injected condition | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| P01 | Same command arrives concurrently | covered | `test_duplicate_commands_concurrently_have_one_receipt` — 4 threads, identical receipts, exactly one `OperationPrepared` event |
| P02 | Same command ID, changed parameters | covered | `test_changed_content_with_same_command_id_rejected` — `COMMAND_ID_REUSED` |
| P03 | Two plan revisions from the same state version | covered, with caveat | `test_conflicting_plan_revisions_use_compare_and_swap` — sequential two-command CAS baseline; genuinely concurrent plan revisions are not separately tested |
| P04 | Receipt lost, command resent | covered, with caveat | `test_duplicate_commands_concurrently_have_one_receipt`, `test_rejected_command_replay_remains_rejected` — resend returns the original receipt; transport loss is simulated by re-invocation, not a dropped socket |
| P05 | Same submission re-proposed under a new command ID | covered | `test_new_command_same_business_operation_reuses_identity` — same Operation identity; two dispatches → exactly 1 accepted OA application |
| P06 | Crash between intent commit and dispatch | partial | `test_prepared_intent_survives_restart` — recovery is exercised through a clean restart, not a crash injected at that exact point; real process deaths are injected for P07 and P15 |
| P07 | External success, local result lost to a crash | covered | `test_actual_process_crash_after_external_commit` — worker subprocess exits 73 after the OA commit; recovery queries the same business key; still exactly 1 accepted application |
| P08 | Approval arrives before the wait is registered | covered | `test_early_approval_and_duplicate_callback_do_not_lose_wakeup` — stored event triggers the wait; duplicate callback is a no-op |
| P09 | Old-version approval and duplicate callbacks | covered | `test_conflicting_source_event_preserves_original` (`SOURCE_EVENT_CONFLICT`), `test_late_event_does_not_reopen_closed_work` |
| P10 | Plan revision deletes the approval step | covered | `test_missing_approval_cannot_be_deleted_with_plan` — the E05 obligation survives; submission blocked |
| P11 | Authority revoked after acceptance, before dispatch | covered | `test_authority_revoked_before_dispatch_holds_intent` — dispatch held, zero external calls |
| P12 | `request_completion` without acceptance evidence | covered | `test_completion_needs_business_evidence` (E08 blocker), `test_timeout_after_commit_then_reconcile` (`OUTCOME_UNRESOLVED` until reconciled) |
| P13 | Worker lease expires while an old call still runs | **deferred** | Requires distributed leases/fencing with external enforcement. The prototype has a single local coordinator; no distributed lease semantics are implemented or claimed, and no distributed exactly-once guarantee is asserted. Planned under roadmap 0.4. |
| P14 | Amount unknown / invoice set not closed | covered | `test_unknown_amount_blocks` (`APPLICABILITY_UNRESOLVED`), `test_empty_and_unsealed_invoice_sets_block` (E01 pending blocks submission) |
| P15 | Evaluation process crashes after evidence adoption | covered | `test_verification_crash_rolls_back_adoption_and_evaluation`, `test_real_process_death_during_evidence_adoption` — real `os._exit(74)`; re-evaluation succeeds after restart |

Net: **11 cases fully covered; P03 and P04 covered with caveats (sequential CAS baseline; simulated receipt loss); P06 partial (clean restart only); P13 explicitly deferred — 14 of 15 have named-test evidence.** Single-process recovery (restart, subprocess death) is real; "crash" never means an exception was caught and ignored.

## RFC-001 acceptance behaviors (R1–R7)

R1 restart/persistence — `test_prepared_intent_survives_restart`, `test_wait_expiry_survives_restart`, P07/P15 tests. R2 plan edits cannot delete requirements — P10 test. R3 unknown conditions block — P14 tests. R4 timeouts are not failures — `test_timeout_after_commit_then_reconcile`, `test_unknown_without_query_result_requires_attention` (no query result → `needs_attention`, no blind retry). R5 content change invalidates old confirmations — `test_existing_invoice_proof_reused_after_document_change`, `test_invoice_revision_invalidates_old_verification`, `test_unknown_old_content_blocks_new_submission`. R6 duplicate/late callbacks — P08/P09 tests. R7 no success without goal evidence — P12 tests.

## SOP example rules and review cases (E01–E08, T01–T12)

The demonstration policy turns most of rules E01–E08 from [RFC-002 §4](RFC-002-sop-authoring-and-binding.md) into executable checks (`work_runtime/policy.py`): set-closedness (E01), per-invoice validity (E02), cross-work uniqueness via the external stand-in (E03, `test_external_uniqueness_across_works`), unknown-amount blocking (E04), over-limit approval (E05), content-bound confirmation (E06), and acceptance evidence before closure (E08). E07 (original invoices must not be rewritten) is only **partially enforced**: the demo capability allowlist grants no invoice-write capability at all, so protected fields are excluded by construction rather than by an independently evaluated check. Of the review judgments T01–T12, the ones mirrored by named tests include T02/T07 (P14 tests), T05 (E05/confirmation invalidation tests), T09 (P10 test) and T10 (P07/P12 tests); the remaining judgments are still desk reasoning in [reference scenarios](reference-scenarios.md). The rule-card publication process itself (RFC-002 §6) is **not implemented**.

## Explicitly out of scope

- Remote or multi-tenant authentication and authorization (local principal names only).
- Policy/SOP publication, migration tooling and author review workflow.
- Evidence revocation workflows, cancellation and compensation (`request_cancel` is rejected explicitly: `test_unsupported_command_explicitly_rejected`).
- Distributed execution: worker leases, fencing, cross-node coordination (P13).
- Any real external system adapter; `FakeOA` is a local demonstration.
- General natural-language rule formalization.
